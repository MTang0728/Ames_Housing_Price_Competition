In this project, I performed EDA, imputation, categorical feature encoding and feature engineering to prepare the data. For regression model, I used both XGBoost and Random Forest regressor. 

The final result has an error of approximately 14,000 and ranked top 4% on Kaggle at the time of this notebook.
